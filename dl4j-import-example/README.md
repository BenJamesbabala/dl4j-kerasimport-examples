#DL4J Examples for Importing Keras Models

This project contains an example for importing deeplearning models trained on Keras to Deeplearning4j to embed them in JVM applications.

The (first) example used here is InceptionV3 network trained on ImageNet dataset, used for image recognition.
 
 
## Build instructions
+ As of February 11, 2017, the examples in this code are based on snapshots of deeplearning4j, ND4j and Datavec which 
  were built from source code.
+ deeplearning4j version  0.7.3 is required. since it is not released (at the time of writing), it was built and installed from source repo
+ deeplearning4j requires ND4j and DataVec, with the same matching versions => build and install them from source


## Example Usage
Import this maven project into your IDE and run the `main` method inside `KerasInceptionV3Net`.
 
#### Sample Code:
```java
String modelFile = "data/inception-model.json";
String weightsFile = "data/inception-model-weights.h5";
String classMapFile = "data/imagenet_class_index.json";
File imagesDir = new File("data/images");
KerasInceptionV3Net net = new KerasInceptionV3Net(modelFile, weightsFile);
try (InputStream is = new FileInputStream(classMapFile)){
    net.loadClassIndex(is);
}
for (String imageFile: imagesDir.list((dir, name) -> name.endsWith(".jpg"))) {
    INDArray imgData = net.preProcessImage(new File(imagesDir, imageFile).getPath());
    long st = System.currentTimeMillis();
    List<Label> results = net.classify(imgData);
    long timeTaken = System.currentTimeMillis() -  st;
    System.out.println(imageFile + ":: " + timeTaken + "ms" + " ::: " + results);
}
```

#### Sample output:
```
